# Overview

Self-Driving Car Engineers have two unique approaches to autonomous development: The **Robotics Approach** and a **Deep Learning Approach**

The **Robotics Approach** uses output from a suite of sensors to directly measure the vehicle's surroundings and then navigate accordingly

Using deep neural networks, the **Deep Learning Approach** allows self-driving cars to learn how to drive by mimicking human driving

Both the Robotics and Deep Learning methods are actively being used in the development of self-driving cars
