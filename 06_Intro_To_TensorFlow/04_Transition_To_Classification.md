# Transition To Classification

Great job so far! In the next few videos you'll learn about how to apply neural networks in the context of classification.
Good job! You've accomplished a lot. In particular, you did the following:

- Ran operations in tf.session.
- Created a constant tensor with tf.constant().
- Used tf.placeholder() and feed_dict to get input.
- Applied the tf.add(), tf.subtract(), tf.multiply(), and tf.div() functions using numeric data.

You know the basics of TensorFlow, so let's take a break and get back to the theory of neural networks. In the next few videos, you're going to learn about one of the most popular applications of neural networks - classification.
