# How to think about Machine Learning development

Deep learning is a hands-on empirical field. The more experiments that we engineers and researchers try, the more ideas we generate, and some of them actually turn out to work. Other ideas that seem promising initially don't work in the end. The practice is definitely ahead of the theory in many cases so it's not to get too attached to theories about different network architectures or exactly what layer follows another in a network. Instead to be a successful deep learning practitioner you need a bias towards action. Experiment to answer your questions rather than just thinking deep thoughts. Don't be too discouraged if something doesn't work immediately the first time you try it, keep experimenting until you find a network and hyperparameters that work for the problem.
