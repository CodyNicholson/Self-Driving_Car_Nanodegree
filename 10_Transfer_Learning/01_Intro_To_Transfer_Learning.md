# Introduction to Transfer Learning

At this point we have built and trained deep neural networks from the ground up. Deep learning engineers often don't start with a blank slate when they are building neural networks. Starting from scratch can be time-consuming. It's not just the architecture - you also have to experiment with it, train it, and adjust it to make it better.

To accelerate this process engineers often begin with a pre-trained network and then modify it to their needs. Fine-tuning an existing network is a powerful technique because improving a network takes much less effort than creating one from scratch. Going even further, we can take an existing network and repurpose it for related but different task.

Repurposing a network is called **Transfer Learning** because you are Transferring the learning from an existing network to a new one
