# Deep Learning History

Neural networks have been in use since the 1950s. As far back as the late 1990s there was a network called LeNet built by Yann Lecun that the post office and banks used to read digits on mail and checks and it was incredibly important. Even after one LeNet, not a lot of interest picked up in Neural Networks. Deep Learning has only really taken off in the last five years.

Why did it take so long?

Some of the reasons it has taken off lately is the increased availability of labeled data along with the greatly increased computational throughput of modern processors. For a long time we didn't have the huge labeled datasets that we needed to make deep earning work. Those datasets only became widely available with the rise of the Internet which made collecting and labeling huge datasets feasible. Even when we had big datasets we often didn't have enough computational power to make use of them. It has only been in the last five years that processors have gotten big enough and fast enough to train large-scale neural networks.
