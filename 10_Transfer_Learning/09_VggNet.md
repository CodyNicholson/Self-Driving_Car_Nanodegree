# VGG Net

VGG Net is an image classification neural network with a 7% classification error made by the visual geometry group at Oxford University to participate in the ImageNet competition

VGG has a simple and elegant architecture which makes it great for transfer learning. The VGG architecture is just a long sequence of 3x3 convolutions broken up by 2x2 pooling layers and finished by a trio of fully connected layers at the end.

Lots of engineers use VGG as a starting point for working on other image classification tasks and it works really well. The flexibility of VGG is one of its great strengths.
