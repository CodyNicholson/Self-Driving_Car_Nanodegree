# ResNet

The 2015 ImageNetwinner was an algorithm from Microsoft Research called ResNet. ResNet's strength is that it has a massive 152 layers. AlexNet only has 8, VGG only has 19, and GoogLeNet only has 22.

ResNet is similar to VGG in the the same structure is repeated again and again for layer after layer. The main idea was to add connections to the neural network that skip layers so that very deep neural networks could practically be trained. ResNet achieves a loss of only 3% on ImageNet which is actually better than normal human accuracy.
