# Training & Testing Data

In the above code **we train and test on different sets of data**. This is very important in machine learning because if you don't do that you will overfit your training data. This will make it hard for your program to generalize data it will see in the real world.

To solve this problem, we should save 10%-20% of our training data and use it as testing data. When we test our classifier - since this will be new data our classifier has never seen - it does a good job of simulating what it will be like in the real world when the classifier sees new data for the first time.
