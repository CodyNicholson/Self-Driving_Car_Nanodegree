# Bias & Variance Dilemma

A high bias machine learning algorithm is one that practically ignores the data. It has almost no capacity to learn anything, and it is called a bias. A bias car would be one that I can train, and no matter which way I train it, it doesn't do anything differently. This is generally a bad idea in machine learning.

It is also possible to have a machine learning algorithm that is extremely perceptive to data, and it can only replicate things it has seen before. This is called a high-variance algorithm. The problem with this is that it will react very poorly in situations that it has not seen before because it doesn't have the right bias to generalize to new things.

In reality, what you want is something in the middle of a biased and a high-variance algorithm. You want an algorithm that has some authority to generalize, but is still very open to listen to the data.
