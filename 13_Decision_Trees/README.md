# Decision Trees

Like Support Vector Machines, **Decision Trees** can create linear decision boundaries, and has a trick to let you do nonlinear decision boundaries as well. They can be used as classifiers and to do regression.

### Strengths

- Very intuitive graphically, you can look at the result and understand it easily
- Easy to use
- You can build bigger classifiers out of decision trees called **ensemble methods**

### Weaknesses

- Prone to overfitting, especially if you have data with lots of features (You have to be careful with the parameter tunes)
- You have to know when to stop the growth of the tree
