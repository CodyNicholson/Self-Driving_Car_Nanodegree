# Kalman Filter

The *Kalman Filter* is a popular technique for estimating the state of a system (Tracking). They estimate a continuous state, and as a result, the Kalman Filter happens to give us a uni-modal distribution.

The Kalman Filter allows us to predict where in the future and object most likely will be, and what velocity it is moving at
