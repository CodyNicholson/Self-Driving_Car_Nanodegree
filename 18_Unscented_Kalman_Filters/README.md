# Unscented Kalman Filters

In this unit we learned how UKFs can be used to achieve better results than a EKF. We were first introduced to a more sophisticated process model that is able to estimate the turn rate of a vehicle. Then we were shown how the UKF deals with this nonlinear process model. Lastly, we implemented the filter in C++ and used it to solve a challenging tracking scenario.
