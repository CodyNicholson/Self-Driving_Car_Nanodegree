# Localization Intuition

A robot takes information from its environment and compares it to information it already knows about the real world. Humans do something very similar. Imagine you are kidnapped and blindfolded - you have no idea where you are when the blindfold is removed and you saw the Eiffel Tower. You would then know that you are in Paris, France.

This is an example of a person using localization, we can program self-driving cars to do the same
