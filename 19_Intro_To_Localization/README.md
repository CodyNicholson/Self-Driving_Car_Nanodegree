# Intro To Localization

In the previous lesson we learned about sensor fusion and how to combine different sensor readings like lidar and radar data with the help of Kalman filters

Now we will go into localization - which allows an autonomous car to know precisely where it is. Without localization it would be impossible for self-driving cars to drive safely. At the end of the localization lesson we will be able to implement high-performance localization software in C++ for autonomous cars.
