# PID Control

Control is how we use the steering, throttle, and brakes to move a car where we want it to go. In this unit we will learn how to implement a collection of important controllers.

When a human turns through an intersection, we use our intuition and experience to determine how hard to steer, when to accelerate, and whether to step on the brakes. Control algorithms are often called controllers and one of the most common and fundamental controllers is the **PID Controller**.
