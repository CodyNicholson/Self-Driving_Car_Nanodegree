#Linear to Logistic Regression

Now that you understand linear regression is about predicting values from past events, how about classifying using data? In situations like determining if a patient has cancer, the species of fish, or who's talking in a room are all classifications problems. This is where logistic regression comes in.

Logistic regression problems are common in self driving cars. It's important to classify the difference between a car, pedestrian, and many other objects in the world. You also need to classify what sign you're looking at or what the stop light is indicating. It's impossible to create an autonomous car without using classification.

In the next video, Luis will go over logistic regression to classify if a student will be accepted to a university. This will lead to neural networks, where you'll eventually apply all this knowledge to build a neural network that classifies.
