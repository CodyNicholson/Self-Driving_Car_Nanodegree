# Neural Networks

In this unit we begin to understand the underlying principles and best practices of neural networks. We cover:

- Perceptrons - A linear threshold unit that we could network together to produce any boolean function
- Perceptron Rule - Runs in finite time for linearly separable datasets
- General Differentiable Rule - Back propagation & gradient descent
- Preference & Restriction Bias of Neural Networks
