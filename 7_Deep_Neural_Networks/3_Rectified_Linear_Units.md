# Rectified Linear Units (RELU)

**RELUs** are the simplest non-linear functions there are. They are linear if x is greater than 0, and they are 0 everywhere else. 

RELUs have nice derivatives as well. The derivative of the segment to the left would be zero, as the value remains constant (x=0), and to the right would be a constant (=1) since it grows linearly (y=x).
