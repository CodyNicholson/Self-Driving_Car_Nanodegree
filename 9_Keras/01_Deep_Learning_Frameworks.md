# Deep Learning Frameworks

Deep neural networks are a big part of making a car drive. It is possible to make a car drive itself using entirely deep neural networks in a technique called **Behavioral Cloning** or end-to-end learning (because the network learning to predict the correct steering wheel angle and speed using only the inputs from the sensors).

Why go with deep learning over a robotics approach?

The robotics approach to building self-driving cars involves a lot of detailed knowledge about sensors controls and planning

With a deep learning approach we don't have to program all that detailed knowledge into the vehicle, we simply feed all the information we have into the network and then we let the network figure out on its own what is important. Deep learning also allows us to build a feedback loop for the more we drive, the more data we can collect, which in turn allows us to learn how to drive even better.
